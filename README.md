PennAI: AI-Driven Data Science
==================================

**PennAI** is an easy-to-use data science assistant.
It allows researchers without machine learning or coding expertise to run supervised machine learning analysis through a clean web interface. 
It provides results visualization and reproducible scripts so that the analysis can be taken anywhere. 
And, it has an *AI* assistant that can choose the analysis to run for you.   Dataset profiles are generated and added to a knowledgebase as experiments are run, and the AI assistant learns from this to give more informed recommendations as it is used.   PennAI comes with an initial knowledgebase generated from the [PMLB benchmark suite](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/penn-ml-benchmarks).
