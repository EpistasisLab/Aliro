Aliro: Accessible Data Science
==================================

**Aliro** is an easy-to-use data science assistant.
It allows researchers without machine learning or coding expertise to run supervised machine learning analysis through a clean web interface.
It provides results visualization and reproducible scripts so that the analysis can be taken anywhere.
And, it has an *AI* assistant that can choose the analysis to run for you.

About the Project
=================

Aliro is actively developed by the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) 
in the `Department of Computational Biomedicine <https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/departments-institutes/computational-biomedicine.html>`_ 
at `Cedars-Sinai Medical Center <https://www.cedars-sinai.org/>`_ in Los Angeles.
Contributors include Hyunjun Choi, Miguel Hernandez, Nick Matsumoto, Jay Moran, Paul Wang, and Jason Moore (PI).
You can find our original position paper on `arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00594>`_.
A more recent preprint describing the AI methodology will be available on arxiv soon.
