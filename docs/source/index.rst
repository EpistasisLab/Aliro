PennAI: Accessible Data Science
==================================

**PennAI** is an easy-to-use data science assistant.
It allows researchers without machine learning or coding expertise to run supervised machine learning analysis through a clean web interface. 
It provides results visualization and reproducible scripts so that the analysis can be taken anywhere. 
And, it has an *AI* assistant that can choose the analysis to run for you.
