A bunch of methods to describe datasets as completely as possible.


A good starting point it so implement metafeatures described in Alexandros Kalousis's thesis "Algorithm Selection via Meta-Learning" and other relevant works.



**to do list**
- not sure if `get_meta_features_pmlb.py` and `get_metafeatures.py` can be removed. (asked Bill, wait for reply)
