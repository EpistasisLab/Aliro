# Calinski-Harabasz (FGLab)

## Introduction

The Calinski-Harabasz criterion is a heuristic for comparing clustering solutions on the same data [1]. Without delving into the details or assumptions of either the clustering algorithms or the Calinkski-Harabasz criterion itself, this example will simply calculate the best solution found for the Iris flower dataset [2] by using grid search. The algorithms that will be compared are *k*-means clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The number of clusters, *k*, will vary from 1-6.

This example has been adapted from [Evaluate clustering solutions - MATLAB evalclusters](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/evalclusters.html). 

## Requirements

- [MATLAB](http://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
- [JSONlab](http://iso2mesh.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?jsonlab)

The `matlab` binary must be available on [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). The JSONlab library should be available on [startup](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html).

## Instructions

1. Create a new project from [calinski-harabasz.json](calinski-harabasz.json).
1. Set up [FGMachine](https://github.com/Kaixhin/FGMachine/blob/master/examples/Calinski-Harabasz).
1. Open the optimisation page and change the following values for *k*:
  - min: 1
  - max: 7
  - #: 6
1. This example is simple, so reduce the Retry Timeout to 60s.
1. Start grid search.

## Results

The following are the results of running the code on MATLAB R2015b - your results may vary, but the trends should remain: The ideal number of clusters is 3.

| algorithm      | k | CH          |
|----------------|---|-------------|
| kmeans         | 3 | 561.6277566 |
| linkage        | 3 | 558.0580408 |
| kmeans         | 4 | 530.4920531 |
| linkage        | 4 | 515.0789062 |
| kmeans         | 2 | 513.924546  |
| linkage        | 2 | 502.8215635 |
| kmeans         | 5 | 495.5414877 |
| linkage        | 5 | 488.484904  |
| kmeans         | 6 | 473.6576725 |
| linkage        | 6 | 464.9493915 |
| linkage        | 1 | \_NaN\_     |
| kmeans         | 1 | \_NaN\_     |

Each experiment also produces two scatter plots to show the clustering - one based on sepal length vs. sepal width, and the other based on petal length vs. petal width. Note that FGLab automatically displays uploaded images, so it is possible to create the plots within MATLAB and have them displayed on the experiment page.
